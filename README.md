## Unuselessness
For many reasons which all sound strange, I often find myself in need of references to a grid system on my screen. And each time I switch to a new working environment, I would inevitably write a few lines of code to make a new tile image which would later become my desktop background. Repeating this time after time is tedious and probably also foolish, so here comes this repo.

## To make a tile
Generate an empty openframeworks app and copy the code under "src/". Build and run the app, then press "return" to save the tile image locally.
